# eApprox
C program that approximates e and e^x. Examples TBA.

# Algorithm: Basic Overview
This program relies on the principle that the function e<sup>x</sup> is a graph of its own slope. That is, the derivative of e<sup>x</sup> is also e<sup>x</sup>.

With this in mind, the program's functions are broken down below:

1. Start at point (0, 1).
2.
